Hi, welcome to my page. I am Changrui, you can also call me Ray. Now I am a PhD student at [CS department](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/) of City University of Hong Kong(CityUHK), where I am supervised by Prof. [Ziye Ma(马梓业)](https://gavenma.github.io/). Before that, I am an undergraduate student at Wuhan University, majoring in Information and Computational Science (also called Computational Mathematics), where I was fortunate to receive guidance from Prof. [Jiwei Zhang(张继伟)](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=8yZhQ7kAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and Prof. [Jie Hu(胡捷)](https://maths.whu.edu.cn/info/4241/132851.htm).


My research interest lies in understanding machine learning from an optimization perspective, including non-convex problems and new optimization algorithms.
