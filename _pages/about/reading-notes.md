I enjoy taking notes when I learn new things and I put them on GitHub. Here is the list:

- [Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/0917Ray/Reading_Notes/tree/main/Reinfoce%20Learning), by [Shiyu Zhao](https://www.shiyuzhao.net/), Westlake University
- [Optimization for data analysis](https://github.com/0917Ray/Reading_Notes/tree/main/Optimization%20for%20Data%20Analysis), by [STEPHEN J. WRIGHT](https://wrightstephen.github.io/sw_proj/) and [BENJAMIN RECHT](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~brecht/index.html)
