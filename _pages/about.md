<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Now I am an undergraduate student at Wuhan University, majoring in Information and Computational Science(also called Computational Mathematics). During my undergraduate studies, I was fortunate to receive guidance from Prof. [ZHANG Jiwei(张继伟)](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=8yZhQ7kAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and Prof. HU Jie(胡捷).

I will begin my doctoral studies in Fall 2025, at [CS department](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/) of City University of Hong Kong, where I will supervised by [MA Ziye(马梓业)](https://gavenma.github.io/).

My research interests include machine learning and optimization theory.
